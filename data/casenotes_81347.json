"Case Note": "Initial home visit with the Walker family following a referral for possible child neglect concerning Marco (8). Marco has reportedly been attending school with dirty clothes and appearing unkempt. Met with both parents, Elizabeth and Jeremy, and their children, Marco and Delilah (4). The home was clean and well-maintained. Delilah was well-groomed and appeared cared for. Marco was shy and reserved, but engaged appropriately with his parents and sister. Discussed the concerns raised in the referral with Elizabeth and Jeremy. They expressed frustration and shared that Marco has been increasingly difficult to manage, particularly with his morning routine. They suspect he may have ADHD, as he exhibits many of the symptoms, but he has not received a formal diagnosis. Explained the importance of addressing Marco's needs and ensuring he is prepared for school. Provided information on resources for ADHD assessment and support. Scheduled a follow-up visit in two weeks to discuss progress and further assess the situation."
